# GenomeAsistant
This project validates Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) identifiers in public databases. From an ID, the tool not only gathers genomic data but also employs web scraping techniques to extract relevant information from the literature on Google Scholar. Finally, it uses AI algorithms to classify the collected information for easier analysis.
